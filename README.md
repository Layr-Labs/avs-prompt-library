# avs-prompt-library
Library of prompts to feed your LLM through stages of [AVS](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/developers/Concepts/avs-developer-guide) idea, design and prototype (code) generation. For these tools, please limit your idea and designs to focus on the scope of **one [Operator Set](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/concepts/operator-sets/operator-sets-concept)** at at time.

## Stage 1 Idea Refinement

This stage takes a high level AVS idea, validates whether it is a good fit to be built as an AVS and outputs the idea as a refined "idea prompt". 

Example refined idea prompt will include:
1. Your project: what is the name of _your project_ and what value does it provide for its users?
2. Purpose: what benefit does the AVS provide to securing, validating or decentralizing _your project_.
3. Name: what do you want to name your AVS? Or do you want the LLM to name it for you ðŸ˜‰?
4. Operator Work: which core work or task will the Operators that comprise your AVS do?
5. Validation: The work is validated through [todo - insert a description of your validation logic at a high level]
6. Rewards: send Rewards distributions to Operators based on [todo]
7. Slashing: slash the Operator's stake when the following outcomes occur: [todo]

## Stage 2 Design Generation

This stage takes a refined "idea prompt"
