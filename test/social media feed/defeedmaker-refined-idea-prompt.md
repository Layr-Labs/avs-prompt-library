# DeFeedMaker Refined AVS Idea

## 1. Project Overview
DeHacker is a decentralized social media application that provides value to its users by offering a platform for content sharing and interaction without centralized control, enhancing privacy and censorship resistance.

## 2. AVS Purpose
DeFeedMaker secures and decentralizes the news feed generation for DeHacker, ensuring that content aggregation is performed in a trustless manner without relying on centralized algorithms or authorities, thereby enhancing the platform's overall decentralized nature.

## 3. Name
DeFeedMaker

## 4. Operator Work
Operators will:
- Pull a list of posts from Hacker News (https://news.ycombinator.com/)
- Aggregate these posts into a curated news feed
- Prioritize content based on interest level and relevance to web3
- Provide references to the original posts alongside the generated feed
- Submit the resulting feed to the network for validation

## 5. Validation
The work is validated through verification that:
- Operators actually pulled the claimed posts from Hacker News
- The aggregation follows predetermined rules for content selection
- The ranking of content based on web3 relevance follows agreed-upon criteria
- All references to original posts are accurate and verifiable
- The feed generation process meets performance and reliability standards

## 6. Rewards
Rewards distributions to Operators will be based on:
- Accuracy of feed generation compared to validation criteria
- Consistency and reliability of service provision
- Quality of content relevance assessment
- User engagement metrics with generated feeds
- Uptime and response time performance
